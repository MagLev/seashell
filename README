***************************************************************************************************
!!! Important !!! Remove the line GEMS="9001 9002 9003" from the file runSeasideGems on your server.
The GEMS environment variable will be automatically controlled by SeaShell.
***************************************************************************************************

Remarks
=======
- Make shure your server does NOT load your login profile, when connecting with a non-login shell (Some systems do, I heard! Ubuntu doesn't.).
  This potentialy could override some environment settings from the capistrano recipes.
- Your applications are stored in /opt/gemstone/applications/<app_name>
- Don't be confused by the name "gem". It is also used by ruby, not only by gemstone.
- Remove the line GEMS="9001 9002 9003" from the file runSeasideGems on your server.
- Include the vhost configuration files in the lighttpd.conf with this line at the end of the file:
  include_shell "cat seaside_applications/*.conf"
- Tested with Gemstone 2.3.1, running on a 256MB slicehost with lighttpd as frontend web server.
          
How to install
==============
- get it as (ruby-)gem "dassi-seashell" from github.com (if available already) or get it directly as source from github.com
- Put everything in a folder "deployment" (or similar) at your project folder on your development machine.
- Depends on (ruby-)gem "capistrano" (>=2.5.5)

How to use
==========
- Open a shell in your deployment subfolder (probably named "deployment")
- Fill in some configurations in the file config.rb
- Run "cap -T" on the shell to get a list of tasks and their description
- Optional: Add a file on top level called tasks.rb, which will hold your project specific additional tasks.
